### Getting started

1. You must have related packages installed. If you have installed python with anaconda the you will most of the packages preinstalled.
Every tutorial readme contains way to install that packages. Follow the instruction to install Anaconda if you don't have yet.

#### Installing Anaconda
Anaconda is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. You can find the installers and installation instructions at https://www.anaconda.com/download/.

If you already have Python installed on your computer, this won't break anything. Instead, the default Python used by your scripts and programs will be the one that comes with Anaconda.

Choose the Python 3.6 version.Also, choose the 64-bit installer if you have a 64-bit operating system, otherwise go with the 32-bit installer. Go ahead and choose the appropriate version, then install it. Continue on afterwards!

To avoid errors later, it's best to update all the packages in the default environment. Open the Anaconda Prompt application. In the prompt, run the following commands:

```
conda upgrade conda
conda upgrade --all
```
and answer yes when asked if you want to install the packages.
